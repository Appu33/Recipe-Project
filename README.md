1. 🍽️ FIREBASE RECIPE PROJECT

1.1 OVERVIEW

This project implements a data pipeline using Firebase Firestore to manage and analyze recipe, user, and interaction data.
It extracts, transforms, validates, and visualizes data to generate actionable insights on recipes and user engagement.

The pipeline demonstrates end-to-end data engineering skills, including ETL, data validation, and analytics.


2. 📁 FOLDER STRUCTURE


2.1 SCRIPTS AND FILES

4]    seed_recipes.py — Seed recipe data into Firebase 🍲

5]    seed_users.py — Seed user data 👤

6]    seed_interactions.py — Seed interaction data 👍

7]    validate_data.py — Data validation script ✅


2.2 DATA & CONFIG



1]   recipe.csv — Exported recipes data

2]   ingredients.csv — Exported ingredients data

3]   steps.csv — Exported recipe steps

4]   interactions.csv — Exported user interactions

5]   admin_key.json — Firebase service account key 🔐

6]   screenshots/ — Folder to store charts and visualizations 📸



3. 🗂️DATA MODEL



3.1 USER

Fields: user_id, name, email, age, gender, created_at

3.2 RECIPES

 Fields: recipe_id, name, description, ingredients, steps, difficulty, created_by

3.3 INTERACTIONS

 Fields: interaction_id, user_id, recipe_id, type (view, like, cook), timestamp, rating

 Relationship: Users interact with Recipes through Interactions 🔗

 

4. ⚙️ ETL PIPELINE



4.1 EXTRACT

 Retrieve data from Firebase Firestore collections (users, recipes, interactions)

4.2 TRANSFORM

Normalize data into separate tables: recipes, ingredients, steps

 Clean fields and standardize difficulty and timestamps

4.3 LOAD

Export transformed data into CSV files: recipe.csv, ingredients.csv, steps.csv, interactions.csv

Tools Used: Python 🐍, firebase_admin, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn



5. ✅ DATA VALIDATION



5.1 VALIDATION RULES

1]  Required fields must be present

2]  Numeric fields must be positive

3]  Arrays for ingredients and steps must not be empty

4]  Difficulty must be Easy, Medium, or Hard

5.2 VALIDATION SCRIPT

validate_data.py generates a report showing valid and invalid records with reasons



6. 📊  ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS

   

6.1 Sample Insights

1] Top recipes based on likes and cook attempts

2]  Most common ingredients across recipes

3] Average preparation time by difficulty

4] Difficulty distribution of recipes

5] Correlation between prep time and likes

6] Most frequently viewed recipes

7] Ingredients associated with high engagement

8] Users with highest interactions

9] Interaction type distribution (views, likes, cooks)

10] Recipes with highest average rating

11] Visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, and ingredient frequency plots



7. 🚀 HOW TO RUN

   
 
7.1 Install Dependencies

   
pip install -r requirements.txt

7.2 Seed Firebase Data (Optional)



python seed_users.py


python seed_recipes.py


python seed_interactions.py

7.3 Run ETL Pipeline



python etl_pipeline.py

7.4 Validate Data



python validate_data.py

7.5 Generate Analytics



python analytics.py

8. ⚠️NOTE

1] Recipe IDs in Firebase are auto-generated

2] User interactions are preserved even if recipes are deleted

3] Analytics are batch-oriented, not real-time

4] Charts generated by analytics are stored in the screenshots/ folder 📸

9. 📝 CONCLUSION

1] This project demonstrates a complete Firebase-based data engineering workflow, including:

 Data modeling and normalization
 ETL pipeline implementation
 Data quality validation
 Analytics and visualization insights
